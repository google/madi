## Forest Cover Data Set (FC)
The original ForestCover/Covertype dataset from UCI machine learning repository
is a multiclass classification dataset. It is used in predicting forest cover
type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). This study area
includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of
northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused
disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of
ecological processes rather than forest management practices. This dataset has
54 attributes (10 quantitative variables, 4 binary wilderness areas and 40
binary soil type variables). Here, outlier detection dataset is created using
only 10 quantitative attributes. Instances from class 2 are considered as normal
points and instances from class 4 are anomalies. The anomalies ratio is 0.9%.
Instances from the other classes are omitted.
