        "Consider a target process that generates a sequential stream of multidimensional data points $x(1), x(2),...$, where the $i^{th}$ data point $x(i)$ , is a $D$-dimensional vector $x=\\left \\{x_{1}, x_{2},...,x_{D}\\right \\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$. The target process may be either a single discrete unit, or a homogeneous cohort of equivalent units. Our objectives are to (a) estimate $P(x\\in Normal)$, and (b) attribute the anomaly score on to each dimension as an interpretation for each anomalous $x$.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Definition 1.** An *anomaly* is any data point $x$ with a near zero probability that it was generated by the Normal process: $P(x\\in Normal)\\approx 0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Normal** process occupies one or more discrete manifolds or volumes of unknown shape, in $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$, which are populated in high density by the target process, except for the small subset of anomalous points that fall outside the Normal volume(s). The **Anomalous** volume is the complement of the Normal volume in $\\mathbb{R}^{D}$. A **unimodal process** occupies a single discrete volume, and a **multimodal process** occupies two or more spatially disconnected volumes.\n",

        "###Detecting Anomalies with Negative Sampling\n",
        "The Concentration Phenomenon states that there is exponentially more room in higher dimensions than in lower dimensions. Intuitively, as the number of dimensions $D$ increases, the cube has $2^{D}$ corners, so most of the volume is concentrated near them, and manifolds tend to occupy less volume relative to the full space (vanhandel2016, vershynin2018).  Based on the Concentration Phenomenon, we propose a simple method for developing a labeled data set to train a classifier for our anomaly detection task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach to anomaly detection is to define two class samples, and train a classifier function $F:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\rightarrow [0,1]$ to distinguish between the two classes. The **positive class sample** $U=\\left \\{ u(1), u(2),...,u(M) \\right \\}$ is the set of $M$ $D$-dimensional data points\\footnote{Every $u$ and $v$ are $D$-dimensional points like $x$, and we use letters $u$ and $v$ to distinguish the positive (observed) sample $U$ from the negative sample $V$.} that were observed by the target process, including a small number of unlabeled, actual anomalies, which our anomaly detection algorithm is expected to detect. Because the positive sample is contaminated with a small number of anomalous data points, there is also a false positive labeling error, $P(u\\in Anomalous)\u003e0$. However, because anomalies are rare by definition, the probability that any point drawn from the positive sample is normal is nearly one, independent of dimensionality $D$.  The **negative class sample** $V=\\left \\{ v(1), v(2),...,v(N) \\right \\}$  is chosen independently and uniformly from the cube bounded by the extrema of each dimension plus some small $\\pm\\delta$, where the volume bounded by the negative sample is strictly greater than the volume bounded by the positive sample, $Vol(U)\u003cVol(V)$. The **sample ratio**, $r_{s}=\\frac{N}{M}$, governs the ratio between the negative sample size and the positive sample size, where $r_{s}=0$ represents the one-class anomaly detection classifier. Since the negative class is intended to represent the space of anomalies, and there is a nonzero probability that a negative sample point will land within the normal region, $P(v\\in Normal)\u003e0$, we also have a false negative labeling error. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Assumption 1** (Sufficiency): *The positive sample U is representative of a stationary, ergodic Normal process.* As with all supervised approaches, the training set should reflect the prediction set, and it is essential to sample enough to reflect all Normal modes of behavior. In monitoring climate control devices, it is important to sample from all hours of the day, and days of the week, even when fixing seasonal conditions. \n",
        "\n",
        "Ideally, we would like to train a binary classifier $F$ with data that has as few labeling errors as possible. Intuitively, it makes sense to develop an algorithm that carefully selects the negative sample to avoid the Normal space. For example, Gonzalez2002 proposes a type of region-growing approach that avoids choosing points close to the positive sample.  However, such a sampling approach is difficult and/or computationally expensive in high dimensions because we are not able to characterize the positive volume. Instead, we observe that volumes tend to contract in high-dimensional spaces, and propose using uniform i.i.d. sampling for generating the negative sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Proposition 1.** (Uniform Negative Sampling): For each dimension $d \\leq D$, let $lim_{d}=\\left [ min\\left ( U_{d} \\right ) -\\delta, max\\left ( U_{d} \\right ) +\\delta  \\right ]$ be a range bounded by the extrema of the positive sample $U$ extended by a conservative positive length $\\delta$ that extends $lim_{d}$ beyond the normal space. We assume that the sample size of $U$ is sufficiently large to bound the Normal region. Choose a negative sample $V$, by selecting $N$ points uniformly i.i.d. bounded by $lim_{d}$ for each $d \\leq D$. In high dimension, $ D \\rightarrow \\infty $, false negative sampling error decays exponentially to zero, regardless of the shape of the Normal region.}\n",
        "\n",
        "*Proof.* While it can be shown that specific shapes such as the sphere or Gaussian contract to zero volume in high dimensions, we choose the hypercube for the normal volume with lengths bounded by the extrema $\\Delta u_{d}=max \\left ( U_{d} \\right ) - min \\left ( U_{d} \\right )$ since its relative volume decreases most slowly with increasing dimension. Since we are sampling uniformly, the probability of a false positive is the relative volume $P\\left ( v \\in Normal \\right ) = \\frac{Vol(U)}{Vol(V)}$.  The length of dimension $d$ in the negative volume is $\\Delta v_{d} = \\Delta u_{d} + 2 \\delta$ . Since $\\Delta u_{d} \u003c \\Delta v_{d}$ for all $d \\leq D$, as the dimensionality $D$ increases, the false negative error descends exponentially to zero $P \\left ( v \\in Normal \\right ) = \\lim_{ D  \\rightarrow \\infty } \\prod_{d}^{D}\\frac{\\Delta v_{d}}{\\Delta u_{d} }=0$ .    \n",
        "\n",
        "The rate at which $P \\left ( v \\in Normal \\right )$ decreases depends on the geometry and volume of the Normal region. Proposition 1 provides upper-bounded asymptotic guarantees that can be strengthened given knowledge of the geometry of the Normal volume. However, when the characteristics of the Normal region are unknown, without loss of generality, we can use Proposition 1 to bound the false negative probability $P \\left ( v \\in Normal \\right ) \\leq \\prod_{d}^{D}\\frac{\\Delta v_{d}}{\\Delta u_{d} }$ Next, we apply Proposition 1 to develop a simple procedure for developing a dataset that can be used to train an anomaly detection classifier.\n",

        "**Proposition 2.** (Labeled Training Set for Anomaly Detection): *Given a sufficiently sampled, high-dimensional dataset from a target process and uniform negative sampling, we can generate a labeled two-class dataset to train a classifier $F$ for detecting anomalies.*\n",
        "\n",
        "A good training set requires a low number of labeling errors for a classifier to learn decision boundaries. In this application, both false positive and false negative errors are small. By our definition of an anomaly, false negative occurrences are rare and $P \\left ( u \\in Anomalous \\right ) \\approx 0$, so $U$ can be used in training data to represent the Normal class. By Proposition 1, uniform negative sampling can be used to generate accurate labeled data representing the anomalous regions, when $ D  \\rightarrow \\infty$.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The **sampling ratio**, $r_{s}$, specifies the density of negative data points since the Negative Sample volume is fixed. In lower dimensions, it is possible to oversample in the Negative Sample, such that $P \\left ( v \\in Normal \\right ) \\approx P \\left ( u \\in Normal \\right )$ and a classifier is unable to learn decision boundaries. The sample ratio should be chosen within $r_{s,min}:P \\left ( u \\in Anomalous \\right ) \\ll P \\left ( v \\in Anomalous \\right )$ and $r_{s,max}:P \\left ( v \\in Normal \\right ) \\ll P \\left ( u \\in Normal \\right )$.\n",

        "\n",
        "Given that the classifiers are universal function approximators, such as deep ReLU networks (Hanin2019), there is no limitation to the number of distinct modes, shapes, or orientations of continuous, high-dimensional Normal volumes. Negative-sampling classifiers detect “bad interactions”, where the values of all dimensions are within Normal ranges, but in aggregate, the points are in the Anomalous region.  \n",
        "\n",
        "If the positive sample size, the dimensionality, and the classifier hyperparameters (number of estimators, tree depth, number layers, layer width, etc.) are fixed, and we assume that, in general, classifier training time grows linearly with the size of input, then the run-time complexity incurred during training of negative sampling depends on the sampling ratio only, $O(r_{s})$, and remains constant, $O(1)$, at inference."
