  Given a reference point and a sample point of length N, we wish to determine
  the distance as the integral of gradients, from sample to reference.

  To compute the integral numerically, we compute and sum the integrals over an
  fixed number of steps between the two points for each variable. This solution
  is based on using the Keras optimization.get_gradients() method.

  The NN model trained to detect anomalies is queried for variable attribution.

  In this application, the baseline is the closest conformal point. The
  IG results which variable(s) caused the model to claim the point to be
  anomalous.
